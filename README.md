## prerequesites
- custom branch of pokeemerald-expansion
    - copy the debug elf file `pokeemerald.elf` and linker map `pokeemerald.map` into the project's res folder
    - i cannot provide prebuilt roms for obvious reasons. build instructions are in the fork readme
- devkitpro installed (recommended to also have devkitARM's gdb executable in your PATHs located in `(devkitpro dir)/devkitARM/bin/`)

### todo list
- [ ] remove requirement for a custom fork of pokeemerald-expansion
